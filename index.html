            <h3>Food Testing</h3>
            <p>I know firsthand how special family recipes can be — my mom’s cucumber salad and my grandma’s potato salad are two of my most-cherished recipes. So when I came across MHudson’s Dad’s Creamy Cucumber Salad on Allrecipes, I was intrigued. She describes the recipe, which is passed down from her dad, as a “family all-time summer favorite,” and it has garnered a solid five-star rating with more than 270 reviews. A number of commenters even said this salad brought back fond memories of a similar version they enjoyed growing up.

                A few things set this creamy cucumber salad recipe apart. You start by salting the sliced cucumbers and sweet onion, then letting them sit for an hour to drain. The dressing is largely made up of mayonnaise (a generous 1 1/2 cups) which is mixed with a small splash of vinegar and dried dill, and the instructions call for chilling the salad for two hours before serving. Here’s how it went when I tried this creamy cucumber salad at home.</p>

            <h3>Cucumber Salad</h3>
            <p>How to Make Allrecipes’ Dad’s Creamy Cucumber Salad
                You’ll start by mixing peeled, sliced cucumbers, a sliced sweet onion, and sea salt together in a large bowl, then cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then you’ll transfer the mixture to a colander to drain the accumulated liquid, stir together, and let it sit for another 30 minutes to drain a little more.
                
                Transfer the cucumber mixture to a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, dried dill, garlic powder, and black pepper and stir until smooth. Pour the dressing over the cucumbers and onion, stir to coat, and cover and refrigerate for at least two hours before serving.!</p>
